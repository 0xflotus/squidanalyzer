NAME
    SquidAnalyzer v4.4 - Squid access log report generation tool

REQUIREMENT
    perl 5.005_03 or higher and the following Perl modules:

            GD
            GD::Graph
            GD::TextUtil
            GD::Graph::bars3d;

    See GD and GD::Graph requirements for other needed libraries.

    If they are not yet include in your OS distribution you can always find
    them at http://search.cpan.org/

    If you have Internet access from your server, you can execute the
    following command to install GD::Graph::bars3d and all its dependencies.

            perl -MCPAN -e 'install GD::Graph::bars3d'

    Images output format is PNG so libgd must be compiled with libpng.

INSTALLATION
  Generic install
    If you want the package to be intalled into the Perl distribution just
    do the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

    Follow the instruction given at the end of install. With this default
    install everything configurable will be installed under
    /etc/squidanalyzer. The Perl library SquidAnalyzer.pm will be installed
    under your site_perl directory and the squid-analyzer Perl script will
    be copied under /usr/local/bin.

    The default output directory for html reports will be
    /var/www/squidanalyzer/.

  Custom install
    You can create your fully customized SquidAnalyzer installation by using
    the Makefile.PL Perl script. Here is a sample:

            perl Makefile.PL \
                    LOGFILE=/var/log/squid3/access.log \
                    BINDIR=/usr/bin \
                    CONFDIR=/etc \
                    HTMLDIR=/var/www/squidreport \
                    BASEURL=/squidreport \
                    MANDIR=/usr/man/man3 \
                    DOCDIR=/usr/share/doc/squidanalyzer

    If you want to build a distro package, there are two other options that
    you may use. The QUIET option is to tell to Makefile.PL to not show the
    default post install README. The DESTDIR is to create and install all
    files in a package build base directory. For example for Fedora RPM,
    thing may look like that:

            # Make Perl and SendmailAnalyzer distrib files
            %{__perl} Makefile.PL \
                INSTALLDIRS=vendor \
                QUIET=1 \
                LOGFILE=/var/log/squid/access.log \
                BINDIR=%{_bindir} \
                CONFDIR=%{_sysconfdir} \
                BASEDIR=%{_localstatedir}/lib/%{uname} \
                HTMLDIR=%{webdir} \
                MANDIR=%{_mandir}/man3 \
                DOCDIR=%{_docdir}/%{uname}-%{version} \
                DESTDIR=%{buildroot} < /dev/null

    See spec file in packaging/RPM for full RPM build script.

  Local install
    You can also have a custom installation. Just copy the SquidAnalyzer.pm
    and the squid-analyzer perl script into a directory, copy and modify the
    configuration file and run the script from here with the -c option.

    Then copy files sorttable.js, squidanalyzer.css and
    logo-squidanalyzer.png into the output directory.

  Post installation
    1. Modify your httpd.conf to allow access to HTML output like follow:

            Alias /squidreport /var/www/squidanalyzer
            <Directory /var/www/squidanalyzer>
                Options -Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride None
                Order deny,allow
                Deny from all
                Allow from 127.0.0.1
            </Directory>

    2. If necessary, give additional host access to SquidAnalyzer in
    httpd.conf. Restart and ensure that httpd is running.

    3. Browse to http://my.host.dom/squidreport/ to ensure that things are
    working properly.

    4. Setup a cronjob to run squid-analyzer daily or more often:

         # SquidAnalyzer log reporting daily
         0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/squid-analyzer > /dev/null 2>&1

    or run it manually. For more information, see README file.

    You can use network name instead of network ip addresses by using the
    network-aliases file. Also if you don't have authentication enable and
    want to replace client ip addresses by some know user or computer you
    can use the user-aliases file to do so.

    See the file squidanalyzer.conf to customized your output statistics and
    match your network and file system configuration.

CONFIGURATION
    See README file.
